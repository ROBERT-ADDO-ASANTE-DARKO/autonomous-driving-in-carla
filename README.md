# autonomous-driving-in-carla
 This repository contains control theory and computer vision Python code that governs the behavior and navigation of a self-driving car in a simulator called CARLA. The ego vehicle uses a PID controller to adjust the parameters of the ego vehicle such as the throttle, brakes, and the steering angle. This algorithm is implemented within the trajectory_planning.py file.
The object_detection.py file is a modification of the formentioned file, which includes the pretrained YOLOv3 model along with the model weights and network configurations. When the vehicle drives autonomously, the model is able to detect and localize all objects within the vicinity of the vehicle while taking into consideration nearby obstacles.
The manual_control_drive leverages the power of a Convolutional Neural Network inspired by Nvidia to drive a self-driving car for several miles. The car imitates all driving scenarios provided by an expert driver in order to navigate autonomously on a highway. This behavior is known as "behavioral cloning".
These scripts must be run inside the pythonAPI\examples folder within the CARLA simulator folder. Please download the CARLA simulator from Github the YOLOv3 weights from a trusted webpage.
